            <h2>Our Heritage</h2>
            <p>Salem Alta Moda is Egypt’s leading luxury fabrics store. Known among Egypt’s top designers for being the go-to store to shop the highest quality international fabrics, Salem Alta Moda has been setting the trend in Egypt for almost 100 years now. </p>
            <p>Salem’s love and appreciation for fabrics comes from a heritage that tied generations of the family to the profession, dating back to 1911 when the first Salem store was opened in Port Said. At the time, the industry was booming and trade was at its height. Egyptian textiles were the only fabrics available in the market, but with time and with the open of the free market the demand diverged gradually into a high demand for ready-to-wear instead of fabrics. Since then, Salem Alta Moda as a store was established with a slight change in direction, bringing Egyptians the latest in evening wear fabrics. This includes a selection of the finest high-end European fabrics from Solstiss, Ruffo Coli and Dentelles Mery, which are the providers for top designer houses like Elie Saab, Zuhair Murad and Valentino, among others. </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>In 1995, Salem Alta Moda opened up its first branch in Cairo. It expanded even more in 2007, opening its first store outside of Egypt in Dubai, UAE.
                Fabrics and textile trade has been done the same way for centuries, but what Salem Alta Moda is trying to bring to the table now is not just exclusive luxury fabrics. The main aim now is to work on “solidifying the bond between designer and fabric supplier.</p>
            <p>As a brand, it is working on educating people on the role that fabrics play in the fashion industry; that fabrics are the foundation of the industry. Through this process, Salem Alta Moda is working on pushing the industry forward, helping Egyptian designers reach their potential and expand globally. With time, Salem wants to have contributed in creating not only well-educated designers, but also customers who are highly aware of what suits them and what they should be looking for. </p>
